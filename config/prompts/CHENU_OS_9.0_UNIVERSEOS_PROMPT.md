# CHE·NU OS 9.0 — UNIVERSEOS

**Version:** 9.0  
**Extends:** OS 7.0, OS 8.0, OS 8.5, PXR-3, CORE+, LAWBOOK  
**Purpose:** Full Spatial Operating Environment for CHE·NU

---

## SECTION 0 — PURPOSE

UniverseOS transforms CHE·NU into a complete conceptual 3D interface:
- Ideas exist as spatial objects
- Tasks exist as chambers
- Threads exist as paths
- Agents occupy symbolic positions
- Spheres orbit concept clusters
- Portals link conceptual zones
- Entire OS is navigable visually

**UniverseOS is NOT:** a game world, consciousness simulation, or emotional environment.  
**It IS:** a cognitive interface supporting clarity and productivity.

## SECTION 1 — UNIVERSE SHELL (U-SHELL)

```yaml
U_SHELL:
  origin: [0,0,0]
  root_room: "Central Nexus"
  spatial_units: "meters (conceptual)"
  gravity: "none"
  transitions: "smooth"
  rendering: "abstract metaphors"
  safety: "CHE·NU Lawbook enforced"
```

---

## SECTION 2 — CENTRAL NEXUS

The "desktop" of the universe:

- Central floating orb (User Identity Node)
- Orbital layers representing spheres of life/work
- Portal lines to major XR rooms
- Timeline ribbon floating in 3D
- Avatar anchors (PXR-3)
- Interface panels (2D-in-3D)

**Every navigation begins and ends here.**

---

## SECTION 3 — SPATIAL WORKSPACE SYSTEM (SWS)

| Workspace Type | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| Task Chamber | Focus on specific tasks |
| Planning Corridor | Linear planning flow |
| Brainstorm Arena | Creative ideation |
| Decision Chamber | Binary/multi-choice decisions |
| Simulation Hall | CSF simulations |
| Archive Vault | Historical knowledge threads |
| Timeline Gallery | Visual timeline navigation |
| Multi-Agent Collaboration Sphere | Team/agent coordination |

---

## SECTION 4 — UNIFIED NAVIGATION SYSTEM (UNS)

| Nav Mode | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| orbit | Around a center |
| zoom | In/out of clusters |
| portal-travel | Instant transitions |
| glide | Linear movement |
| pivot | Focus change |
| expand | Room blooming |
| collapse | Return to Nexus |

**Rules:** Always reversible, always gentle, never imply real-world motion.

---

## SECTION 5 — SPHERES & ORBITS SYSTEM

```yaml
SPHERE_NODE:
  id: ""
  pos: [x,y,z]
  color: "sphere-specific canonical color"
  child_nodes: [tasks, projects, agents, threads]
```

Spheres: Business, Personal, Creative, Scholar, Institutional...

---

## SECTION 6 — TIMELINE GALLERY

```yaml
TIMELINE_PATH:
  id: ""
  holothread_id: ""
  path_points: [[x,y,z], ...]
  nodes: [decisions, milestones, replays]
```

User can: walk timeline, zoom on threads, reconstruct decisions, visualize evolution.

---

## SECTION 7 — AGENT PRESENCE SYSTEM (APS)

```yaml
AGENT_PRESENCE:
  id: ""
  morphology: (from PXR-3)
  anchor_zone: "structure_cluster | intent_core | timeline_ribbon | simulation_wing"
  behavior:
    idle: "symbolic movement"
    focus: "orientation shift"
    guide: "subtle beam or highlight"
```

**Agents NEVER move autonomously.**

---

## SECTION 8 — ROOM MANAGER (RM)

```yaml
ROOM:
  id: ""
  type: ""
  geometry: ""
  pos: [x,y,z]
  portals: []
  compiled_data: (from OS 8.0)
  fabric_links: (from OS 8.5)
```

---

## SECTION 9 — UI SURFACES IN XR (USXR)

Supported surfaces:
- Floating panels
- Holographic lists
- 2D windows mapped in 3D
- Tables, schemas, workflows

All surfaces are: safe, readable, abstract, reversible.

---

## SECTION 10 — UNIVERSE COMPILER (UC-9)

```json
{
  "UNIVERSE_EXPORT": {
    "id": "universe_session",
    "nodes": [],
    "rooms": [],
    "portals": [],
    "agents": [],
    "spheres": [],
    "timeline_paths": [],
    "metadata": {"version": "9.0"}
  }
}
```

---

## SECTION 11 — SAFETY & ETHICS

UniverseOS MUST:
- ✅ Never simulate emotions
- ✅ Never mimic reality
- ✅ Never imply embodiment
- ✅ Never depict harm or danger
- ✅ Never create emergent behavior
- ✅ Follow CHE·NU Lawbook entirely
